# Project Name: SimpleSQL

## Description

SimpleSQL is a comprehensive SQL execution environment designed to provide a seamless and user-friendly experience for executing SQL queries. This project comprises five essential components: Scanner, Parser, Analyzer, Query Planner, and Execution Engine. Together, these components work harmoniously to process and execute SQL queries efficiently, making data manipulation and retrieval a breeze.

## Key Components

### 1. Scanner
The Scanner component is responsible for converting the input SQL query into a sequence of tokens. It identifies keywords, identifiers, literals, and symbols, which are then passed to the Parser for further processing.

### 2. Parser
The Parser takes the tokenized input from the Scanner and constructs a syntactic tree, representing the grammatical structure of the SQL query. It validates the query's syntax and produces a structured representation for the Analyzer to work with.

### 3. Analyzer
The Analyzer component performs semantic analysis on the parsed SQL query. It ensures that the query adheres to the rules and constraints of the underlying database schema. This step involves checking table and column existence, data types, and permissions.

### 4. Query Planner
The Query Planner is responsible for devising an optimal execution plan for the SQL query. It takes into consideration indexes, join strategies, and other factors to create a plan that minimizes execution time and resource usage.

### 5. Execution Engine
The Execution Engine executes the query plan generated by the Query Planner. It interacts with the database, retrieves data, performs joins and aggregations, and returns the query results to the user.
